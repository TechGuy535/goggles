As you are mastering you want to feel comfortable with your fingers on keys. If you are hitting the edges of keys and 
you are not even sure that you are hitting the right keys and you feel like you are getting lucky. You are not quite
there yet.

Drills
The idea that you want to try to move your finger 25 to 50 times as practice between hard finger movements.
place your fingers on the home row with your right hands index finger on j
move your finger from j to 6 and back again without moving your hand.
A way to drill this is open a text file and then do this
j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^_j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^j^
j --> shift + 6
semicolon --> dash
semicolon --> equal
+ --> )

This is an idea that I found helps when you lose where your hands are when typing hard things.
normalize your hands on the home row.
to find left brackets and braces move your pinky diagonally once you are normalized.
to find the right bracket and braces
